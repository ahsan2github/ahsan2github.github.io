# Summary of Ahsan's projects hosted on GitHub

## Repository : [bw_method](https://github.com/ahsan2github/bw_method)
This repository contains a an explnation of the `Best-Worst Method` along with a sample implementation of the method using Python
 linear programming tool linprog . Best-Worst Method is a `multi-criteria decision analysis tool`. This was first proposed by Dr. Jafar
 Rezaei in 2015. This project contains 3 files. Here is a short description of the files the project is comprised of.
 
##### [bw_method.pdf](https://github.com/ahsan2github/bw_method/blob/master/bw_method.pdf) 
This pdf file describes a hypothetical problem of choosing a DSLR camera based upon multiple criteria and the corresponding decision
 making process utlizing the Best-Worst method. Below is an excerpt from the file.

```
Once you have been fixated on purchasing a full frame DSLR camera, you immediately take a survey of the available options and 
would probably come up with a list of Canon, Nikon, Sony, Pentax cameras. Well, this just is the beginning of the complexity. Most cameras are very similar in specifications but not exactly the same. What option may be useful to me may not be important for the  other buyer .... 
```

##### [bw_method_weight_scipy.py](https://github.com/ahsan2github/bw_method/blob/master/bw_method_weight_scipy.py)
A reusable python function.

```
This is simple function that generates the matrices required to be solved in the Best Worst method and then solves the linear
 optimization problem using scipy linprog routine.
```

##### [bw_method.py](https://github.com/ahsan2github/bw_method/blob/master/bw_method.py)
The driver python script that calls bw_method_weight.py function to calculate the weights for Best-Worst method.
